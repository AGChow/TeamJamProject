The font(s) included in this zip were created by Doggybag. This readme serves as a license. By using my fonts, you agree to it. 
I'm not willing to freely give out my personal information at the time of creation of this license.
On the rare occasion I feel the need to pursue legal action, I will make my information available on my website.
I want the use of my fonts to be as unrestrictive as possible, so the information provided here will be sparse and I may be willing to provide further wiggle room if contacted.

1. Distribution restrictions
-You may NOT resell my font files, whether as part of a font pack or by itself, without my express permission.
-You may not claim that you made my fonts or distribute them without credit. (this readme will suffice)
-You may not modify the font files to remove my credit.
-You may not adapt my fonts into your own publicly distributed typeface without crediting me.
-You may not distribute my fonts with a modified readme.

2. Distribution exceptions
-You MAY distribute my font files to friends.
-You may include my fonts in your font pack as long as a profit isn't being made off of it.
-You may distribute my fonts on your website, as long as this readme is included with them and you don't pretend to have created them.
-You may distribute my fonts with your free software if they are implemented in it. All I ask is that you include this readme in the folder they are kept in, but this isn't required.
	+If you want to include my fonts with your paid software, such as a design suite or operating system, seek my permission first.
	+If your software is donationware or ad-supported there is no need to contact me.

3. Conditions of use
-You MAY use my fonts in design work, paid or otherwise.
-You may use my fonts in your personal or commercial website. All I ask is you credit me somewhere, if possible, but it isn't required.
-You may use my fonts in any publication, whether it be small or large.
-You may use my fonts on physical commercial products. 

If your use case doesn't fall into any of these or you aren't sure, contact me. If you're using my font, I'd love to see a picture of what it's being used for!

Thanks!
